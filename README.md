# spatial

Some variations and samples on the scipy.spatial theme.  

Note: All of this was built on a debian stable distribution using the
latest version of python3.x that comes with the distro.  In many cases
I had to upgrade packages to more recent versions using pip3.  Some of
the code requires some modifications I made (with lots of help from
Tyler Reddy) to scipy.spatial.  None of this has been tested on a
Windows machine.  I don't think this even works with python2.x.
